This is a port of the BMLite_Nordic, from andpp.

This is designed to run on STM32 hardware, specifically the STM32F0DISCOVERY.  

This will output the correct messages, but I have failed to get an ACK reply.  This is either due to an oversight on my end, or bad hardware.  In either case, this would make a good starting point for stm32 development.

This is run by combining all .c files in src folder for "System Workbench for STM32", all .h files in inc folder, and building.
